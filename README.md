## A Lua script to spawn various objects in GTA Online using Yimmenu.

## Side Notes :
- These objects will not be attached to anything and are not usable except ramps and lights. You can also spawn chairs then use a sitting animation from Yimmenu. Oh, and a bush that you can hide inside... (idk, don't even ask why)
- You can spawn objects in front of other players if you select them from Yimmenu's player list before spawning a prop.
- Objects will spawn on the ground, facing the player. This is to avoid using the script to grief other players. This script was made solely for roleplaying purposes. 
- Adjust the distance and direction before spawning the object.

## Issues :
* It's probably full of bugs. At this point, I don't even know what I'm doing.

[Deadlineem](https://github.com/deadlineem) for letting me borrow the distance sliders from their [Extras Addon](https://github.com/Deadlineem/Extras-Addon-for-YimMenu). I almost gave up.
