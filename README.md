## A Lua Script That Spawns Several GTA V Objects Using YimMenu.

![object_spawner](https://github.com/xesdoog/object-spawner/assets/66764345/42f49eea-28a3-44d4-9c7c-ae8bdf900d89)

## Notes :
- These objects will not be attached to anything and are not usable except ramps and lights. You can also spawn chairs then use a sitting animation from YimMenu. Oh, and a bush that you can hide inside... (idk, don't even ask why)

- By default, objects will spawn on the ground, facing the player. You can move spawned objects by enabling Edit Mode.

- To reposition the object, drag the corresponding **Axis** slider and hold it. Adjust the speed at which the object moves by dragging the slider while holding LMB down. The farther from the center, the faster the object moves in that direction.

## Issues :
* Some props can be used as _wrecking balls?_ I will probably have to disable object collision in Edit Mode.
