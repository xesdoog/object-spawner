## A Lua script to spawn several objects in GTA V using YimMenu.

![object_spawner](https://github.com/xesdoog/object-spawner/assets/66764345/42f49eea-28a3-44d4-9c7c-ae8bdf900d89)

## Notes :
- These objects will not be attached to anything and are not usable except ramps and lights. You can also spawn chairs then use a sitting animation from YimMenu. Oh, and a bush that you can hide inside... (idk, don't even ask why)
- By default, objects will spawn on the ground, facing the player. You can either set a custom spawn position using the sliders before spawning the prop or enable Edit Mode and reposition it later.
- To reposition the object after spawning it, drag the corresponding **Axis** slider and hold it. Adjust the speed at which the object moves by holding and dragging the slider. The farther from the center, the faster the object moves in that direction

## Issues :
* Some props can be used as wrecking balls? I will probably have to disable object collision in **Edit Mode**.
